	<text readMore=""><![CDATA[<p>Periodontal treatment starts with prevention: regular cleanings and good hygiene habits are excellent precautions to avoid gum disease. The main cause of periodontal disease is bacteria in the form of a sticky, colorless plaque that constantly forms on your teeth; however, other factors can cause the disease or influence its progression. Scaling, root planing and local delivery of antimicrobials can treat and prevent the progression of the disease. In some cases, surgical therapy or cosmetic solutions may be necessary to correct the damage from gum disease physically and cosmetically. We will evaluate your situation and present the best treatment options for you.</p>]]></text>
