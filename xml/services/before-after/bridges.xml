	<text readMore=""><![CDATA[<p>A dental bridge is a custom device anchored to neighboring teeth that replaces one or more missing teeth. When a lost or damaged tooth is replaced with bridgework, the teeth on either side of the missing one are prepared as crowns to serve as abutments to hold the prosthetic (replacement) tooth in place. Crowns and bridges are most commonly prepared from high quality materials such as semi-precious or precious metals, porcelain or a fused combination of the two. Aesthetics, function and tissue compatibility are considered when selecting the material most suitable for you.</p>]]></text>
