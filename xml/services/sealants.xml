	<text readMore=""><![CDATA[<p>A sealant is a plastic material that is usually applied to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. The grooves in the back teeth are more difficult to reach with a toothbrush and naturally attract and collect bacteria, which leads to decay. Sealing the tooth helps prevent this decay. The plastic material fits into the grooves of these back teeth and acts as a barrier, protecting the enamel from plaque and acids. They are easy for your dentist to apply...often it takes only a few minutes to seal each tooth. Sealants hold up well to natural activities, such as chewing, and usually last several years before a reapplication is necessary. Children and teenagers are the most common candidates for sealants, but adults can greatly benefit from them as well.</p>]]></text>
