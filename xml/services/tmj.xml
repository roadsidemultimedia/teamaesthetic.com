	<text readMore=""><![CDATA[<p>If you suffer from symptoms such as migraines, jaw pain, sinus problems, earaches, ringing in the ears, dizziness or teeth grinding and clenching, neuromuscular dentistry can put an end to your pain!</p>
	<p>Neuromuscular dentistry allows Dr. _______ and ________ to approach your care and treatment with a broader, "whole body" focus. Traditional dentistry assumes that your current bite, the way that your teeth fit together, is right for you. Often, this is not the case. Rather than assuming that your present jaw position is optimal, our doctors use specialized equipment to study the pattern of your jaw movements and then can diagnose the exact cause and nature of the problem, which allows us to determine the proper course of treatment.</p>]]></text>
