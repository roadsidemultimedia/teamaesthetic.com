	<text readMore=""><![CDATA[<p>If you are one of millions of people who suffer from symptoms such as migraines, jaw pain, sinus problems, earaches, ringing in the ears, dizziness or teeth grinding and clenching, neuromuscular dentistry can put an end to your pain! Using neuromuscular dentistry, We follow a broader, "whole body" approach to treatment. Traditional dentistry assumes that your current bite, the way that your teeth fit together, is right for you. Many times this is not the case. Rather than relying on your present jaw position as being the most optimal, we use computerized equipment to study the pattern of your jaw movements. All of the tests are non-invasive and can lead to a better quality of life!</p>]]></text>
