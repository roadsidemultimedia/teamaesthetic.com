	<text readMore=""><![CDATA[<p>Sedation dentistry, sometimes known as “sleep dentistry,” can help patients who normally have difficulty doing so to completely relax through their appointments. This treatment is ideal for those with dental fears or those who have difficulty getting numb.. It can also turn multiple appointments into a single visit. Patients take a pill prior to treatment. Though completely relaxed, patients will be awake enough to respond to the doctor. Sedation dentistry reduces the body’s natural tendency to tense muscles while stressed. This can create a more effective dental visit, allowing for much more to be accomplished, while eliminating concerns about discomfort.</p>]]></text>
