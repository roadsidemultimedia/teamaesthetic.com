	<text readMore=""><![CDATA[<p>We are committed to improving and maintaining the oral health of infants, children, and adolescents. Thanks to fluoride, dental sealants, and better dental habits, 55 percent of school-age children now have no cavities. The dramatic drop in cavities among children with regular dental care is due to regular visits to the dentist starting at an early age, professional teeth cleaning for children, proper tooth brushing habits, fluoride, and dental sealants. We are happy to provide all aspects of preventative dental care and restorative dentistry for your children. We recommend that you begin bringing your children to the dentist for their first check up at ages 2 1/2 to 3 years old.</p>]]></text>
