<p style="text-align: left;"><br /><img style="float: left;" title="Dental Lab Smile" src="../../assets/images/_MG_9281%20copy.jpg" alt="Dental Lab Smile" width="220" height="165" />I am proud to feature a course using the new e.max ceramic for <a href="../../index.html">dental labs</a>. This is a huge ceramic system with many aspects: it has the potential of handling most of our restorative needs. It can be used for everything form ultra thin lithium disilicate veneers for the patient desiring no preparation, to full coverage posterior crowns and bridges. This course will address the different applications and present a strategy to maximize the functional and esthetic results with e.max lithium disilicate restorations. With a flexural strength of 400mpa and new studies showing it to be the most robust restorative material we have today you want this available to your clients. In working with the development of emax for the last 3 years, I have tried many different ways of dealing with the material. In this course I will share what works for me today. We will discuss where to choose the various components of the system: where are the LT and HT ingots most appropriate, how about the MO, or when do we use zirconia as a substructure. We will look at micro layering strategies for the new HT Press ingots, you will learn how to establish beautiful incisal effects while maximizing the strong lithium disilicate core. Each participant will work through a multiunit anterior case which will need to be waxed and pressed in advance. Instruction for this will be available in a on line, video on demand format from the Team Aesthetic site prior to the course. Course dates and fees will be announced.</p>
